# Draw a Bow MT5

This code is a sample expert advisor for MetaTrader 5 (MT5) that implements a martingale strategy for executing trades in the forex market. The code is developed by Forex Robot Easy Team and can be found at [forexroboteasy.com](https://www.forexroboteasy.com).

## Strategy Overview

The expert advisor uses a martingale strategy, which involves progressively increasing the lot size of trades after a loss, in order to recover previous losses and generate profits. The main parameters of the strategy are:

- **LotSize**: Initial lot size for each trade.
- **Multiplier**: The factor by which the lot size is increased after each losing trade.
- **MaxTrades**: The maximum number of trades to execute.

## How it Works

### Initialization (OnInit)

In the initialization function, the necessary parameters and indicators are set up. This includes specifying the lot size, the multiplier, and the maximum number of trades.

### Deinitialization (OnDeinit)

The deinitialization function is responsible for cleaning up and releasing any resources used by the expert advisor.

### Tick Function (OnTick)

The tick function is called on each market tick and is where the main trading logic is implemented. 

1. The code checks for trade opportunities based on specific conditions that are not specified in the provided code.
2. The code then executes trades based on the martingale strategy by iterating through a loop for a maximum of `MaxTrades` times.
3. Inside the loop, the trade size is calculated based on the current lot size and the martingale multiplier.
4. The `ExecuteTrade` function is called to place a trade with the calculated lot size.
5. If the trade is successful (`tradeResult` is true), the lot size is updated with the current trade size. Otherwise, the lot size is multiplied by the martingale multiplier.
6. This process continues for the specified number of trades or until a trade fails.

### Execute Trade Function (ExecuteTrade)

The `ExecuteTrade` function is responsible for placing a trade with the specified lot size and checking the outcome of the trade.

1. The function places a trade with the specified lot size. The details of how the trade is placed are not specified in the provided code.
2. The function then checks the outcome of the trade by calling the `CheckTradeOutcome` function.
3. If the trade is successful (`tradeSuccess` is true), the lot size is updated with the current trade size. Otherwise, the lot size is multiplied by the martingale multiplier.
4. The function returns the outcome of the trade (`tradeSuccess`) to the calling function.

### Check Trade Outcome Function (CheckTradeOutcome)

The `CheckTradeOutcome` function is responsible for checking the outcome of a trade. The details of how the trade outcome is checked are not specified in the provided code.
The function returns true if the trade was successful and false otherwise.
